    /** Class to provide aligned memory allocate functionality.
    @remarks
        All SIMD processing are friendly with aligned memory, and some SIMD routines
        are designed for working with aligned memory only. If the data are intended to
        use SIMD processing, it's need to be aligned for better performance boost.
        In additional, most time cache boundary aligned data also lead to better
        performance even if didn't used SIMD processing. So this class provides a couple
        of functions for allocate aligned memory.
    @par
        Anyways, in general, you don't need to use this class directly, Ogre internally
        will take care with most SIMD and cache friendly optimisation if possible.
    @par
        This isn't a "one-step" optimisation, there are a lot of underlying work to
        achieve performance boost. If you didn't know what are you doing or what there
        are going, just ignore this class.
    @note
        This class intended to use by advanced user only.
