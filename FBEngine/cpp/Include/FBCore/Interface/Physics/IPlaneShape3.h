         *
         * This class represents a physics shape that can be used in 3D physics simulations to represent a plane.
         * It is an abstract base class that defines the basic interface for a 3D plane collision shape.
         * This includes methods for getting and setting the distance from the origin, the normal vector,
         * and the plane equation of the shape.
         *
         * The `IPlaneShape3` class is intended to be subclassed to create specific types of 3D plane collision shapes.
         * Each subclass should implement the pure virtual methods defined in this class to provide the specific functionality for the shape.
         *
